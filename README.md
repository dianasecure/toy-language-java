Toy Language Interpreter 🖥️🚀
This is a Java-based interpreter for a toy programming language, built with a JavaFX interface. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and applies object-oriented programming principles to evaluate and execute simple programs.

Features
📜 Syntax Support – Supports variable declarations, assignments, arithmetic and logical expressions, conditionals, and print statements.

⚙️ Interpreter Components
 
 - Execution Stack (ExeStack) – Manages program execution flow.
 
 - Symbol Table (SymTable) – Stores variable names and values.
 
 - Output List (Out) – Collects printed results.

🖥 JavaFX GUI – Interactive interface for writing, running, and debugging toy programs.

🔍 Live Execution State – View stack, symbol table, and output during execution.

The interpreter evaluates programs step by step, updating the execution stack, symbol table, and output dynamically. At the end of execution, the stack is empty, variables are stored in the symbol table, and all outputs are recorded.
